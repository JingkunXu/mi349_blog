                In my point of view, a game is composed by these elements. They are:
            </p>
            <ul class="BlogList">
                <li>&nbsp;System;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;Rules;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;Conflict;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;Artificial;</li>
                <li>&nbsp;Quantifiable Outcome</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="BlogContent">
                A system says that games are composed of <b>a set of parts that interrelate</b> to form a complex whole. It is the fundamental of game play. Rules provide the <b>structure</b> out of which play emerges and also define the outcome. Rules, in other words, decide the game process. Most games embody a contest of <b>power</b>, and that leads to the competition or intergroup competition, typically: player vs. player, player vs. game system, etc. Game designers have to maintain a <b>boundary</b> between real world and virtual world in both time and space, in order to reduce the effect of game play. Finally, most games will settle a goal for players, and most of the design works for that process, which guides the players to approach similar outcomes. As I quote a summary from Salen and Zimmerman here, 'a game is a system in which players engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome'. Of course, games nowadays contain more elements and game developers are trying to add even more. These elements still need time for scholars to do research before they are added to the list.

                History of Video Game Industry
            </h3>

                The first video game was not convinced by all game scholars since the definition of a video game  is not clear yet. The first home console, that could be called as console, was the Magnavox Odyssey sold in 1972. After that, Pong, as the first arcade game, was released by Atari in the same year. The success of Pong attracted computer programmers to make more games. After the first generation of console and early computer games, the game industry embraced the golden age. Lots of famous arcade games was released at that time, and you can still see them in the market.
                While the console was developed up to fourth generation, improving techniques allowed personal computer to display video games and do the calculation as well. During 1980s and 1990s, online games and 3D games started to appear, and both of them were considered to be the fundamental construction of current games. The market shifted to mobile games gradually in a few years, and the income of mobile games was the majority part of the overall industry. Console companies, the well-known-three, supported platforms that helped more and more fantastic games to get published, and they are still competitive. Computer games, as well as VR games, held considerable amount of player. Now, no matter which device you are playing with, you are creating the history. I start to consider what is the future of video game industry, and I am willing to see more choices.
